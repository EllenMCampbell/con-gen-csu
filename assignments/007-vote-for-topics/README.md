# 007-vote-for-topics

Your homework over spring break is to thoroughly read [this paper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eriqande/con-gen-csu/main/extras/leopard-paper-and-supplements.pdf)
about leopard genetics, and then weigh in on which topics you would most like to discuss/cover
in the remaining weeks of the course.

Here is how you do it:

- Sync your fork and pull main to your clone.
- Create a new branch off of main called `007-rock-the-vote`
- On that branch do the following work:
    + Update the file `syllabus-topics.tsv` in this directory, replacing the 0's in the first
      column with your own ranking of how interested you are in each of these topics. 1 = most
      interested, and 6 = least interested.  **Note: this file is a TSV file.  Make sure you
      preserve the TABS in there and do not introduce any spurious spaces, etc.**
    + Update the file `leopard-paper-topics.tsv`.  There are 18 different topics we might discuss
      further in the class (and implement snakemake workflows for), taken from the leopard paper
      section headings.  We can't do all of them.  Rank each one from 1 to 6.
